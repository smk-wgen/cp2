     <h2>The problem</h2>
     The problem that we attempt to solve is to try and make your long commutes more bearable.
     <h2>What we try to do</h2>
     Giving us your commute info - we try to match you with other Linkedin users. You can then connect with them. Plan your commutes and network.
     Hopefully, interacting with a real human instead of being glued to your electronic device is a makes for a more satisfying and less painful commute.
