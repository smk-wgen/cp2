     <h2>The problem</h2>
     The problem that we attempt to solve is to try and make your long commutes better. What if -
       <ul>
           <li> You could make friends</li>
           <li> Network</li>
           <li> Plan your commute</li>
       </ul>
     <h2>What we try to do</h2>
     Give us your commute info - and we match you with other Linkedin users. You can then connect with them. Plan your commutes and network.
     Hopefully, interacting with a real human instead of being glued to your electronic device makes for a more enjoyable commute.
